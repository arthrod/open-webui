        and the remote storage bucket. It performs the following steps:
        1. Sets up a temporary upload directory using the monkeypatch and tmp_path fixtures.
        2. Uploads two files with known content to the storage provider.
        3. Asserts that the uploaded files exist in the local directory and the corresponding
           blobs in the remote bucket contain the expected names and byte content.
        4. Calls delete_all_files() to remove all files.
        5. Confirms that both the local files and the remote blobs have been deleted.
